    <a href="hex.html"><img src="img/hexmap.png" alt=""></a>
    <p>There are 2 hexmaps here. The first uses a single hexagon to represent each constituency, with each MS represented by a triangle covering 1/6 of the hexagon. The second uses 6 hexagons to represent each constituency, with one MS per hexagon.</p>
